1. Notes Drawer (collapsed by default)

Right now it seems like the drawer is partially expanded on load.

Instead, it should:

Initial state → collapsed (only a thin bar visible at the bottom with "0 notes" + drag handle).

Interaction → user drags/pulls it up OR clicks the bar → then expands smoothly (animate height).

Technical approach → set drawer height: 0 or translateY(100%) initially, and animate translateY(0) on expansion.

2. Calendar last row issue

The last row looks like it’s cut off / visually inconsistent.

Common causes:

The grid isn’t filling all 6 weeks for the month (some libraries auto-trim empty days).

Each day cell has unequal height or the row gap isn’t applied uniformly.

Sometimes if you’re flexing instead of using a strict 7-column CSS grid, the last row breaks.

Fix:

Force a grid-template-rows: repeat(6, 1fr) so all months render in 6 equal rows (even if some are empty).

Empty days → just render as blank cells with correct styling (so the last row doesn’t collapse).

3. Notes Drawer "+" button placement

Currently, "+" is at the extreme top right of the drawer bar (feels like a system control, not contextual).

Better:

When drawer is expanded → show a light shaded box/card with a "+" inside it → that acts as “Add Note”.

This way, the affordance is clear: notes live inside the drawer, not in the nav.

Visual: imagine a subtle card (rounded, light gradient) at the top of the notes list, with + Add Note.

Notes Drawer — Global & Persistent

Always Visible: The notes drawer remains accessible on all views (Month, Day, Hour). Switching between views does not reset or hide the drawer.

Pull-up Interaction: Drawer can be swiped/pulled up from a handle at the bottom of the screen (like iOS Maps/Apple Calendar style).

Global Context: Notes created in the drawer are available globally but can be attached/dropped onto specific views (Month cell, Day block, Hour slot).

Drag & Drop Functionality

Universal Drag: Notes can be dragged out of the drawer and dropped onto:

Month View → attaches to a day cell

Day View → attaches to a time block

Hour View → attaches to a specific slot or sub-task line

Persistence: Once dropped, the note remains in that location until moved again.

If dropped in Month view → appears when user opens that day in Day/Hour view.

If dropped in Day/Hour view → the note also shows up as a marker on the Month view for that date.

Sync Across Views:

Moving a note in one view updates its position in all others.

Example: If I drag a note into 3 PM slot (Day View), it should reflect as a small marker in the Month view for that date.

Edge Behaviors

Multiple Notes per Slot → Stack indicators show how many notes are present.

Quick Actions → Tap & hold on a note in its dropped location lets you:

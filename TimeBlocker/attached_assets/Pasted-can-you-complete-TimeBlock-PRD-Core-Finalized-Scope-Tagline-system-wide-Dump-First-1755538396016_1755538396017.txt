# TimeBlock PRD — Core (Finalized Scope)

**Tagline (system-wide):** **Dump First, Organize Later**
**Status:** Finalized core scope only — no future/optional features included
**Platform:** Web (React + Vite)
**Primary Goals:** Instant capture via persistent Notes Drawer → Progressive scheduling Month → Day → Hour (no separate view buttons)

---

## 1) Scope

**Included (decided):**

* Public Landing (split-screen) with Google Sign-Up + Email capture + Sign-In link
* Authentication UI (Google OAuth button + Email field UI). *Auth backend behavior is out-of-scope; this PRD covers UI flows and states only.*
* Guided Walkthrough (front-end overlay coachmarks; no database)
* Core App Shell with **Month View** (default), **Day View** (on date click), **Hour View** (on hour click)
* **Persistent Notes Drawer** (collapsed/partial/full, dynamic expansion, drag & drop)
* Drag & Drop scheduling across the three levels
* Empty/Loading/Error states, microcopy, accessibility, keyboard/touch behaviors

**Explicitly Out-of-Scope (for this PRD):**

* Pricing page, Teams/Collab, external integrations (e.g., Google Calendar), notifications, settings/profile, data sync, analytics dashboards
* Any backend persistence or auth logic beyond the presence and UI states of the buttons/forms

---

## 2) Global UI/UX System

### 2.1 Visual Identity

* **Background:** White `#FFFFFF` with **soft purple gradient bursts** (top-right → bottom-left) at very low opacity (≈ 6–10%).
* **Accent:** Purple `#8B5CF6` used on interactive elements, selected states, focus rings, and feedback.
* **Gradients:** Primary gradient `linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(139,92,246,0.28), rgba(139,92,246,0))` for hovers, cards, and subtle backgrounds. Avoid heavy fills; keep contrast high.
* **Borders:** Subtle inner borders on components (`#E5E7EB` 1px).
* **Glassmorphism:** Popups/drawers use blurred, semi‑transparent layers: bg `rgba(255,255,255,0.65)`, backdrop‑filter: blur(12–16px), soft shadow.
* **Corners:** Rounded-xl–2xl across interactive surfaces.

### 2.2 Typography

* **Font:** Inter (system fallback allowed).
* **Scale:**

  * H1 (hero/tagline): 32–40px / 600
  * H2 (section headings): 24px / 600
  * Body: 16px / 400
  * Support: 14px / 400
  * Microcopy/Labels: 12–13px / 500
* **Line-height:** 1.4–1.6, generous spacing for scanning.

### 2.3 Motion & States

* **Transitions:** 150–200ms ease-in-out for hover/focus/enter/exit (Framer Motion for overlays/drawer).
* **Hover:** Faint purple glow + 1.02x scale on primary interactive elements.
* **Focus:** 2px focus ring `rgba(139,92,246,0.6)` + 1px solid `#8B5CF6` for WCAG AA.

### 2.4 Priority Colors

* Low: Green `#34D399`
* Medium: Yellow `#FACC15`
* High: Red `#EF4444`

## 3) Public Website (Pre-Login)

### 3.1 Landing — Split Screen (final)

**Layout:** 50/50 split.

**Left Panel (identity + sign-up):**

* Top: **TimeBlock** wordmark (Inter 600, purple gradient fill)
* Hero line (H1): **Dump First, Organize Later**
* Subtext (optional): “Capture tasks now. Arrange them when you’re ready.”
* **Google Sign-Up button** (primary):

  * Left Google icon; text: “Sign up with Google”
  * Glassmorphism surface; hover glow; disabled state for loading
* **Email field + Sign Up** (secondary):

  * Email input with rounded border; placeholder: “Enter your email”
  * Adjacent/stacked button: “Sign Up” (same styling as primary but secondary prominence)
* **Sign In link** under form (inline text link): “Already have an account? **Sign In**”
* Legal micro-links (footer-left): Terms, Privacy

**Right Panel (auto-sliding feature showcase):**

* Carousel (auto 5s, swipe/arrow nav, dots):

  1. 3-Level Navigation — “Month → Day → Hour. No extra buttons. Just click through.”
  2. Notes Drawer — “Persistent, dynamic, and drag-ready.”
  3. Drag & Drop — “Drop from notes into dates and time slots.”
  4. Glassmorphism UI — “Calm. Focused. Futuristic.”
* Each slide is a mocked app screenshot in a rounded ‘browser frame’ card over a subtle gradient burst.

**Accessibility/Keyboard:**

* Tab order: Logo → Hero → Google → Email input → Sign Up → Sign In → Carousel controls.
* Space/Enter activates buttons and carousel arrows; dots are accessible radio-buttons.

**Error/Edge States:**

* Email validation (front-end only): inline message: “Enter a valid email.”
* Google button loading state with spinner; disabled during async.

---

## 4) Guided Walkthrough (Front-End Only)

**Purpose:** Introduce the progressive navigation and the Notes Drawer on first visit.

**Trigger:** First successful “enter app” (post Sign-Up/Sign-In) OR user clicks “Help → Walkthrough”.

**Persistence:** Use `localStorage.timeblock_walkthrough_done = true` once completed or skipped. (No DB.)

**Format:** Overlay + coachmarks with dimmed backdrop; dismissible; keyboard & touch friendly.

**Steps:**

1. **Month View coachmark** (pointing to calendar grid):
   Copy: “This is your Month. Click any date to zoom into the Day.”
   Actions: *Next*, *Skip*.
2. **Drawer coachmark** (peeking drawer handle):
   Copy: “Your Notes Drawer is always here. Write first, organize later.”
   CTA: *Pull up the drawer* (guides user to expand; accepts click on handle or *Next*).
3. **Drag & Drop hint** (note item + calendar):
   Copy: “Drag a note onto a date to schedule it for that day.”
4. **Day View coachmark** (appears after user clicks a date):
   Copy: “Here’s your Day timeline. Drop tasks into hours to set times.”
5. **Hour View coachmark** (appears after user clicks an hour):
   Copy: “Fine-tune in 15‑minute blocks. Precise and fast.”

**Controls:** Next/Back/Skip; Esc closes; focus trapped within overlay while active.

## 5) Core App (Post-Login)

### 5.1 App Shell

* **Header (top):** Left logo; centered date/breadcrumb (“August 2025 • Month”) updating contextually; right: Help (opens walkthrough), user menu placeholder (icon-only, no profile page in scope).
* **Main:** Calendar canvas (fills viewport width; height minus header and drawer). White base with gradient bursts.
* **Persistent Bottom Notes Drawer** (see 5.4).

> **No explicit buttons to switch views.** Navigation is contextual:
> Month View (default) → click a **date** → Day View overlay
> Day View → click an **hour** → Hour View overlay

### 5.2 Month View (Default)

**Layout:**

* 7-column grid (Mon–Sun), 5–6 rows depending on month.
* Day cells: min-height responsive; subtle border `#E5E7EB`; hover lift (shadow + faint gradient).

**Content:**

* Date numeral (top-right small badge).
* Task indicators (dots): max 3 visible; overflow counter “+N”.
* Tooltip on hover: shows up to top 3 task titles + priority chips; if day-level (no time), shows “All day (unscheduled time)”.

**Interactions:**

* Click on a day cell → **opens Day View** for that date as an overlay sliding from bottom (Framer Motion; 200ms).
* **Drag & Drop target:**

  * Dragging a note over a day cell highlights the cell (glow + border).
  * Drop → create **day-level task** (no specific time).
  * Success toast: “Scheduled for Aug 18.”
  * The note is **removed from Drawer** immediately.

**Keyboard/Touch:**

* Arrow keys navigate day cells; Enter opens Day View.
* On touch, long-press shows tooltip; tap opens Day View.

**Empty State (no tasks in month):**

* Center helper text: “Pull up your Notes Drawer and drop your first task.”

### 5.3 Day View (Overlay)

**Invocation:** Clicking any date in Month View.

**Structure:**

* **Header bar inside overlay:** ← Previous Day | **Aug 18, 2025 (Mon)** | Next Day → | **Close (×)**.
* **Timeline:** Vertical 24h, equal-height hour rows; business hours (e.g., 9–6) subtly highlighted.

**Content & Cards:**

* **Day-level tasks** (from Month) appear in an **Unscheduled** strip at the top of the timeline (left-aligned pill list).
* Scheduled tasks render as vertical blocks spanning their time range within the relevant hour rows. Overlaps stack side-by-side with minimal gutter.

**Interactions:**

* **Drop targets:** Each hour row highlights on drag; dropping a note here creates a 60‑minute block by default. (User can resize later — resizing handles on hover.)
* Clicking an **hour row** opens **Hour View** overlay for that specific hour.
* Dragging a **day-level pill** into an hour row schedules it at that hour (default 60 min).
* **Resize:** Drag block edges to adjust duration in 15‑minute increments (snap).
* **Move:** Drag a scheduled block to another hour (snap to 15‑minute grid).

**Keyboard/Touch:**

* Arrow keys move focus across hour rows; Enter to open Hour View.
* Space to pick up a focused task; arrow keys to move by 15 minutes; Enter to drop.
* Touch: press‑hold to pick; drag to hour; lift to drop.

**Tooltips:** Hovering a task shows title, (optional) description, priority, start–end time.

**Toasts:**

* “Task scheduled at 10:00–11:00.”
* “Moved to 14:15–15:00.”
* “Duration set to 30 minutes.”

### 5.4 Hour View (Overlay)

**Invocation:** Clicking any hour row in Day View.

**Structure:**

* Header inside overlay: ← 9 AM | **Aug 18, 2025 • 09:00–09:59** | → | Close (×)
* **Grid:** Horizontal layout split into 4 equal **15‑minute** segments: 9:00, 9:15, 9:30, 9:45 (labels visible).
* Larger click/drag targets than Day View; ample padding.

**Interactions:**

* **Drop target:** Each 15‑min cell highlights on drag; drop creates a 15‑minute task starting at that cell.
* **Resize:** Extend across adjacent cells in 15‑min steps.
* **Move:** Drag to another segment; snapping preserved.

**Keyboard/Touch:**

* Arrow keys move segment focus; Enter to place; Shift+Arrow resizes by 15 min.

**Tooltip:** Shows exact start–end time with minute precision.

### 5.5 Notes Drawer (Persistent)

**Visibility:** Persistent along bottom at all times (Month/Day/Hour). Handle remains visible even when collapsed.

**States:**

* **Collapsed:** 24px tall handle bar with **grip** texture + **task count** badge.
* **Partial:** Expands just enough to show current notes; **auto-expands** depending on note count (never jumps to half-screen by default).
* **Full:** Full composer & list visible (can still be dragged back down to show a single note only).

**Auto-Expansion Rule:**

* Drawer grows as notes are added (list height = min(sum of note rows + padding, 50% viewport)). If it reaches \~50% due to volume, user can **drag back** to reveal **only a single note**.

**Composition Area:**

* Title (single-line), optional description (multi-line expander).
* Priority selector (Low/Med/High).
* “Add Note” button (primary). Enter key submits.

**Note Item (list row):**

* Drag handle (≡), Title, priority chip, optional description teaser, **checkbox** to complete, **kebab menu** (Edit / Delete).
* Hover: subtle lift + glow on drag handle.
* Completed: check → row fades to 60% opacity and moves to bottom of list.

**Drag & Drop from Drawer:**

* On drag start: note card becomes **ghost preview** following cursor.
* Valid drop zones glow (Month cells / Day hours / Hour segments).
* On drop success: remove from drawer list → render in target view.
* On invalid drop: shake micro‑animation + toast “Can’t drop here.”

**Keyboard/Touch:**

* Tab cycles through notes; Space picks up; arrows move tentative position; Enter drops.
* Touch supports press‑hold to pick up.

**Microcopy:**

* Empty state (drawer): “Write your first note below.”
* After add: “Drag this note into the calendar when ready.”

---

## 6) Drag & Drop Specification (Unified)

**Drag Sources:**

* Notes Drawer items (only).

**Drop Targets:**

* Month: day cells → creates **day-level** task (no time yet).
* Day: hour rows → creates **60‑minute** task at that hour.
* Hour: 15‑min segments → creates **15‑minute** task at that segment.

**Snapping:**

* Day view snaps to 15‑minute increments for move/resize; initial placement at hour = 60 min by default.

**Overlap Rules:**

* Overlaps are **allowed**; overlapping blocks stack with a 2–4px gutter. (No conflict errors in core scope.)

**Auto-Scroll:**

* When dragging near top/bottom edges of scrollable overlays, auto-scroll engages at 200–400px/s.

**Feedback:**

* Valid target → highlight + subtle pulse.
* Drop → success toast + brief task block ‘pop’ animation.
* Invalid → shake + error toast.

---

## 7) Information Architecture & Labels

* **Month View:** shows month grid; day labels Mon–Sun header; each cell labeled with date number (aria-label: “August 18, 2025”).
* **Day View:** labeled “August 18, 2025 — Day”; hours labeled 00:00–23:00 with companion 12h badges (e.g., “9 AM”).
* **Hour View:** labeled “August 18, 2025 — 09:00–09:59”; segments labeled 9:00, 9:15, 9:30, 9:45.
* **Priority chips:** text + color (e.g., “High”). Icons for color-blind redundancy (▲ High, ● Med, ▴ Low).

---

## 8) Accessibility (AA)

* **Keyboard:** Fully navigable; focus rings visible; Enter/Space activations; Esc closes overlays.
* **ARIA:**

  * Drawer role="complementary" with aria-expanded state.
  * Overlays are modal dialogs with focus trap and `aria-labelledby`.
  * Tasks have `aria-describedby` with time/priority.
* **Contrast:** All text/buttons ≥ AA; ensure purple-on-white meets contrast.
* **Motion:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` → reduce animation durations and disable pulses.

---

## 9) Copy Deck (Core Microcopy)

* **Hero:** Dump First, Organize Later
* **Landing subtext:** Capture tasks now. Arrange them when you’re ready.
* **Google button:** Sign up with Google
* **Email field placeholder:** Enter your email
* **Email CTA:** Sign Up
* **Sign In link:** Already have an account? Sign In
* **Month empty:** Pull up your Notes Drawer and drop your first task.
* **Drawer empty:** Write your first note below.
* **Schedule success:** Scheduled for Aug 18.
* **Day placement:** Task scheduled at 10:00–11:00.
* **Invalid drop:** Can’t drop here.

---

## 10) Error & Edge Cases

* **Network‑independent UI:** Since core scope excludes backend, all errors are UI-level: form validation, blocked actions.
* **Rapid drag/drop spam:** Debounce toasts; max 1 concurrent toast; queue others.
* **Drawer overflow:** Virtualize list after \~50 items; keep scroll smooth.
* **Very small screens:** Drawer defaults to collapsed; prompts user to pull up.

---

## 11) Performance & Quality

* Target 60fps for drag animations and overlay transitions.
* Avoid heavy blur on low-power devices (`prefers-reduced-transparency`).
* Throttle auto-scroll; memoize tooltip renders.

---
